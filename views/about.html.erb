  <p>I hope you enjoy this website, it has been inspired by <a href="http://blog.joshuanguyen.com/post/7766138893/due-to-an-errant-cron-task-that-ran-twice-an-hour">this video</a> generated by one year of nytimes.com snapshots.</p>
  <p>My contact information are available on my <a href="http://archiloque.net/">personal website</a>, feel free to send me a mail if you have any question (like a major newspaper I've missed) or suggestion.</p>
  <p>I'm archiving both snapshots and sources files (html, css, images), I can provide them if you need them for data processing or something.</p>
  <p>For the technically inclined, the sourcecode of the website is freely available <a href="https://github.com/archiloque/news-memory">here</a> and the archiving / snapshoting capabilities are being isolated in a separated library available <a href="https://github.com/archiloque/webpage-archivist">here</a>.</p>.
